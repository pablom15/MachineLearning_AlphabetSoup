# MachineLearning_AlphabetSoup

## Resources
    - Software: Jupyter Notebook v6.0.3, Python 3.7.6
    - Data Sources: charity_data.csv

## Overview
In this assignment, we were tasked with creating and optimizing a machine learning model that could predict the success of charity funding for Alphabet Soup. The provided dataset was imported, cleaned, and prepped using Pandas Data Frame in order to create our machine learning model. The steps taken to create this model can be found in the attached notebook file.

## Results
1. How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model?
    I selected to have 2 hidden layers in my model with 8 and 5 neurons, respectively.
2. Were you able to achieve target model performance?
    I was not able to achieve the target model performance of 75%. I did achieve a predictive model performance of 73.7%
3. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
    The first step I tried to increase my model performance was to increase the number of layers from one to two. I also increased the number of neurons and additional Epochs (100).
4. If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose and why?
    If I was to implement a different model, I would implement a Random Forest model. The ability to achieve an accurate prediction on large data like the one provided in this challenge with a faster performance may help in creating a target model faster. The data provided relates more to the functionality of this model compared to the additional models gone over in this weeks lesson material.
